# Travis Miller Portfolio - UCI Module 2 Challenge - Advanced CSS

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This is a website that in the future may serve as a framework for a professional portfolio for a web development career after the UCI Coding Boot Camp. The website is built using a collection of flexboxes and other css elements that help the HTML code pop in a browser window. The website is broken up into 4 main sections: the header that houses the title and the navigation bar, an about me section that gives the user some info about me (the coder), a works section providing links to coding projects which will eventually highlight the skills I have learned throughout the course, and a final section that contains contact information.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
In order to use this website, open the webpage (https://tcmiller30.github.io/uci-module-1-challenge/) in your browser to launch the homepage. To confirm non-semantic elements were replaced with semantic elements, you can open the browser's DevTools/Inspector--CTRL+Shift+I for Windows, CMD+Option+I for Mac--which will open a console panel on the side of your screen displaying the site's code.

The Navbar at the top right of the screen can be used to quickly navigate to different sections of the website. The cards in the "Work" section are links that will send the user to the respective projects. There is a second navbar in the "Contact Me" section that the user can use to find a way to contact me (the coder(Travis Miller)).

The webpage should be responsive when viewed on different sized screens

Below is a screenshot of what the website looks like at fullsize.
