            Hello! My name is Travis Miller. I am currently enrolled as a student in a Web Development Bootcamp through UCI, but in the meantime, I work as a barista at a local coffee and donut shop. 
            My first exposure to coding was in a high school elective, and although at the time I decided to dedicate myself to other pursuits, the class left me with an appreciation for computer programming which I am happy to be revisiting.
            My goal is to take the skills I'll have learned at the end of the Bootcamp and use it to dive in to a career in the tech industry. I have been interested in computers since I was a child, it feels right to be pursuing a career related to them as an adult.
          </p>

            In my free time, I like to play Dungeons and Dragons, read, hang out with friends, play video games, and play guitar. I recently started playing D&D online over Discord with friends I made on the East coast
